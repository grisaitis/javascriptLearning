JavaScript Curriculum
==================

This repository contains code I wrote as part of a self-study curriculum in JavaScript. It follows the roadmap laid out at [JavaScript is sexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/). I determined that this was the best roadmap / syllabus out there after doing some research on reddit and googling around.

My main goal is to master JavaScript, and by this I mean: to know how to make awesome shit with it with little time and high independence.

To get to this point, I aim to gain mastery of:
* language fundamentals
** syntax
** built-in data structures and functions
* best practices
** design patterns
** awareness of pitfalls / common mistakes
** implementing basic algorithms (e.g. sorting, graphs, trees) 
* implementing paradigms
** object-oriented
** functional programming 

As of Sep 2014, I'm still in the lame area of having to look things up a lot as I go. I need to get past this, because it's slow / doesn't scale, is not rewarding, and doesn't build my confidence. To address this, I'm throwing in some structure (with the self-study curriculum) and making it public, which I think will motivate me, slash shame me into making progress.
