History & Background of JavaScript
==================

JavaScript traces its roots back to the mid-90s. The original impetus for a client-side scripting language was form validation. At the time, around 1995, form validation was emerging as a common pain-point in web development, because the client had to rely on the server to perform the task. As web sites increased in complexity and functionality, form validation became increasingly common. And it was extremely slow - 30 seconds with an industry-average 28.80 kbps dial-up connection. This brings back memories for me as a child, when 56k modems were as expensive as white truffles. 

To address the issue of slow form validation, developers at NetScape (including one Brendan Eich) created a basic scripting language that could run on the client-side (i.e., be executed by the browser). This enabled, among other capabilities, form validation by the browser, independent of the server. NetScape brought this to market in 1995, dubbing it JavaScript. And you've probably heard why they named it thus... 

Shortly after NetScape introduced JavaScript, Microsoft enabled roughly the exact same language and capability in a new version of their Internet Explorer browser.
